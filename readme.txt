Image Processing Software and C# Bitmap Tools

There is a Parallel Bitmap (PBitmap) class,
you can use to modify Bitmaps Parallel,
for example using the System.Threading.Tasks
Lib.

This as well as the ImageH (Bitmap image handler)
class are just some code i wrote for my self,
but if you should need something like that, 
feel free to use and modify it as you wish.

(if you should find any bugs or have other 
issues, please notify me.)

Have fun :)
